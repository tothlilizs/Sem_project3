# Student Incubator
This is our 3rd semester project created in autumn of 2021 for the Software Engineering course at [VIA](https://via.dk/) university college, campus Horsens, DK. 

## Description
The project is a website based text-based game. The goal is to create an avatar that is a university student and making sure that they stay alive throughout the semester.

For requirement we had to make sure our system was 3-tiered, heterogeneous and utilized two different communication technologies between tiers.
